      <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
      <hr/>
      <p>An independent, non-profit digital library, envisioned and managed by a single individual, I hold this project in my hands for the betterment of my nation, with the hope that it will serve the community and become an enduring charity accessible to all.</p>
      <p>Recognizing the shortcomings of Arabic digital libraries, which often comprise books of little value, inundated with advertisements and cumbersome javascript, along with poor programming leading to frustratingly slow book downloads, I have embarked on creating a digital library that aspires to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Offer Arabic translations, accompanied by their English counterparts, ensuring readers are shielded from substandard translations.</li>
        <li>Present books that foster cognitive awareness, broaden horizons, and move beyond unhelpful novels and self-help works.</li>
        <li>Emphasize books that support tradition while discouraging progress, with particular attention to religious literature.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>A Community-Driven Project</h2>
      <p>Our endeavor is built upon the collective efforts of a community united in the pursuit of knowledge and literacy.</p>
      <p>Contributions is the beating heart of our project - where your contributions and volunteering efforts make all the difference. As a sole individual, I lack the resources to make this project truly impactful.</p>
      <p>There are numerous opportunities for volunteers to get involved, some of which include:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Translation:</strong> Contributing to the translation efforts.</li>
        <li><strong>Texts and Book Summaries:</strong> Enhancing and adding content, including book summaries (a considerable portion of the textual content is generated through artificial intelligence).</li>
        <li><strong>Curriculum Suggestions:</strong> Proposing non-academic curricula.</li>
        <li><strong>Article Submissions or Transfers:</strong> Offering articles or transferring content from other platforms.</li>
        <li><strong>Proofreading:</strong> Identifying and correcting spelling and grammatical errors.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>A top priority of our project is to make the contribution and volunteering process accessible to everyone, even those without technical expertise.</p>
      <h2>Our Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Utilize the best software solutions to ensure a fast and clean website experience.</li>
        <li>Eliminate ads and javascript altogether, preserving a seamless and ad-free reading environment.</li>
        <li>Prioritize ease of use and speed, enabling non-technical individuals to access knowledge without being overwhelmed by technical complexities.</li>
        <li>Put effort into professional-quality typography: use “curly” quotes, details like em- and en-dashes, and ensure that our typography meet a professional-grade and consistent typographical standard.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What Sets Us Apart?</h3>
      <p>Unlike other platforms, such as Telegram channels, which offer files without a dedicated focus on valuable content, we endeavor to deliver exceptional books with aesthetic and professional integrity, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the book’s content.</p>
      <p>Our project transcends the role of a mere book repository. We aim to establish a center for translation, offering curricula to foster knowledge acquisition, preserving valuable articles, and offering an unparalleled aesthetic and textual experience.</p>
      <h3>Translation?!</h3>
      <p>Indeed. We are actively working on an ambitious project to translate books that have been absent from Arab horizons for centuries, books that remained in obscurity for far too long in the minds of Arab readers. Our revolutionary approach involves leveraging the power of artificial intelligence for translation, providing nuanced and contextually accurate renditions. Through this advanced tool, we can produce preliminary translations within a few hours, and with meticulous scrutiny and review, deliver a satisfactory result in record time.</p>
      <h3>Empowering Knowledge Acquisition</h3>
      <p>Acquiring knowledge can be a challenging journey, often leading one to wander among countless books or select unsuitable materials, consuming precious time.</p>
      <p>Our primary aim is to provide the most efficient method for knowledge acquisition, streamlining the process and inspiring individuals to embrace the pursuit of knowledge with clarity and purpose.</p>
      <h3>Our Vision for Articles</h3>
      <p>Our ultimate vision for this platform is to be a comprehensive reference for students of science, offering a vast array of resources to facilitate their quest for knowledge. The significance and transformative impact of articles on individuals cannot be overstated.</p>
      <p>To achieve this, we are striving to create a user-friendly web page for writers to submit articles effortlessly, without the burden of technological expertise. Although the implementation may be intricate due to potential security challenges, rest assured, until then, articles can be submitted via email, including relevant information such as the publisher’s name and address.</p>
      <h3>Inspiration from “Standard Ebooks”</h3>
      <p>Undoubtedly, “Standard Ebooks” project has significantly influenced our design philosophy. While we aspire to create a unique design that aligns with our professional goals and user experience, we acknowledge the inspiration drawn from this project. Our focus remains on the development of programming, content, and site sections. Once we achieve a satisfactory standard in these areas, we will dedicate more effort and time to crafting a distinctive design, setting our project apart from others. With time, I aim to cultivate a strong competence in this aspect as well.</p>
      <h3>Why Not Fork “Standard Ebooks”?</h3>
      <p>Forking “Standard Ebooks” project would require considerable time and effort to adapt to their specific implementation, which may not align with our distinct objectives. Instead, we view this as an invaluable learning experience, as the project has been instrumental in my personal growth and development.</p>
