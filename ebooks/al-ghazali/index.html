      <p>Al-Ghazali, also known as Abu Hamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Ghazali, was born in 1058 in Tus, a city in present-day Iran. He hailed from a humble family and demonstrated exceptional intellectual abilities from a young age. Al-Ghazali received his early education in Tus, studying Islamic law, theology, philosophy, and Arabic grammar.</p>
      <h2>Quest for Knowledge</h2>
      <p>Driven by a deep thirst for knowledge, Al-Ghazali embarked on a journey to seek wisdom and enlightenment. He traveled extensively, visiting renowned centers of learning across the Islamic world, including Nishapur, Baghdad, and Damascus. During his travels, he studied under prominent scholars of his time, mastering various disciplines and developing a profound understanding of Islamic philosophy and theology.</p>
      <h2>Crisis of Faith and Spiritual Transformation</h2>
      <p>Despite his intellectual prowess, Al-Ghazali experienced a period of profound doubt and spiritual crisis. Struggling with existential questions and the limits of human reason, he began to question the philosophical foundations of his education. This led him to retreat from academia and embark on a personal journey of introspection and spiritual transformation.</p>
      <h2>Mystical Awakening</h2>
      <p>During his retreat from public life, Al-Ghazali encountered Sufi mystics and embraced the mystical path. He immersed himself in the teachings of renowned Sufi masters, delving into the practices of dhikr (remembrance of God), meditation, and contemplation. This period of intense spiritual practice and introspection profoundly influenced Al-Ghazali’s philosophical outlook and shaped his subsequent works.</p>
      <h2>The Incoherence of the Philosophers</h2>
      <p>One of Al-Ghazali’s most influential works is “The Incoherence of the Philosophers” (Tahafut al-Falasifa). In this book, he critically examines the philosophical ideas espoused by Islamic philosophers influenced by Greek thought, such as Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and Al-Farabi. Al-Ghazali challenges the rationalist approach of these philosophers, arguing that human reason alone is insufficient in comprehending the Divine and the nature of reality.</p>
      <h2>The Revival of Religious Sciences</h2>
      <p>Al-Ghazali’s magnum opus, “The Revival of Religious Sciences” (Ihya’ Ulum al-Din), is a comprehensive work that addresses various aspects of Islamic spirituality, ethics, and jurisprudence. It provides practical guidance for individuals seeking to deepen their religious commitment and develop a meaningful relationship with God. Al-Ghazali’s emphasis on inward purification, self-discipline, and the importance of spiritual practices has had a profound impact on Islamic thought and Sufi tradition.</p>
