      <p>Carl Schmitt, a German jurist and political theorist, was born on July 11, 1888, in Plettenberg, Germany. His works have had a profound impact on political philosophy and legal theory. Schmitt is known for his provocative and controversial ideas, particularly his critique of liberal democracy and his exploration of the concept of sovereignty. Although his association with the Nazi Party during the Third Reich tarnished his reputation, his ideas continue to be studied and debated in political and legal circles.</p>
      <h2>Autobiography</h2>
      <p>Carl Schmitt’s personal life and experiences are intertwined with his intellectual and political career. He began his studies in law and political science at the University of Strasbourg, where he was exposed to the writings of influential thinkers such as Max Weber and Heinrich Rickert. After completing his doctorate, Schmitt pursued an academic career, eventually becoming a professor of law at the University of Berlin.</p>
      <p>During the Weimar Republic era, Schmitt gained recognition for his legal and constitutional expertise. However, his involvement with the Nazi Party and his support for their ideology stained his legacy. After the fall of the Nazi regime, Schmitt faced a period of isolation and political marginalization.</p>
      <p>Schmitt spent his later years writing and reflecting on political theory and legal philosophy. He passed away on April 7, 1985, in Plettenberg, leaving behind a complex and controversial intellectual legacy.</p>
      <h2>Sovereignty and Political Theology</h2>
      <p>From a philosophical perspective, Carl Schmitt’s ideas are characterized by his exploration of sovereignty and his critique of liberal democracy. Schmitt argued that the essence of politics lies in the struggle for power and the ability to make decisions in exceptional circumstances. He emphasized the significance of the sovereign authority in determining the state of exception and maintaining order.</p>
      <p>One of Schmitt’s notable concepts is that of “political theology.” He suggested that political concepts and ideologies, particularly in times of crisis, often assume characteristics of religious belief systems. Schmitt believed that political theology played a vital role in shaping political identity and legitimizing political authority.</p>
      <p>Another key concept in Schmitt’s philosophy is the “friend-enemy distinction.” He argued that politics is fundamentally defined by the distinction between friend and enemy. According to Schmitt, the political realm arises from the existence of an enemy that threatens the integrity and values of a community.</p>
      <p>Schmitt’s ideas have drawn criticism for their potential to justify authoritarianism and disregard for individual rights. Nonetheless, his works continue to be studied as important contributions to political and legal theory.</p>
