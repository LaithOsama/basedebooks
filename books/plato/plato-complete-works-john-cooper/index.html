      <p class="description">“a comprehensive collection that brings together the entirety of Plato’s philosophical works. It includes dialogues such as ‘The Republic’, ‘Phaedrus’, ‘Phaedo’, and ‘Symposium’, among others, covering a wide range of topics including ethics, politics, metaphysics, epistemology, and the nature of reality.”</p>

      <p>It is a comprehensive collection containing all the works of the famous Greek philosopher Plato. Plato is considered one of the greatest philosophers in history, and this book is a fundamental source for understanding his philosophy and diverse ideas.</p>
      <p>The book covers many of the famous dialogues conducted by Plato, such as “The Republic,” “Symposium,” “Phaedo,” and “The State.” These dialogues deal with a variety of topics, ranging from justice and virtue to politics and philosophy.</p>
      <p>It is considered an essential and necessary book for those interested in philosophy. The book provides a comprehensive understanding of Plato’s ideas and their influence on philosophical thinking in different eras.</p>
      <p>As for other translations of the work, there are three major editions, including the efforts of Benjamin Jowett, Edith Hamilton, and John Cooper. Notably, Benjamin Jowett undertook a bold solitary endeavor, unlike his peers who participated in a collaborative effort involving aggregating and collaborating with other translators, then re-editing, elucidating, and comprehensively compiling.</p>
      <p>Jowett did not translate all the dialogues that modern scholars have agreed were authored by Plato. Such a task would have required a great deal of time. Additionally, the prevailing sense at the time, especially among individuals who felt the lesser dialogues were unworthy of attention, made translating all the dialogues less productive. These views were particularly shared among those who considered these dialogues to be fundamentally important to a niche group of dedicated scholars, who master reading the Greek language and thus benefit more from reading them in their original tongue. Jowett’s translations have been criticized as archaic and stilted by many, and remain present in editions because of the canonical status of his work, and are an option for publishers desiring to provide a modern translator.</p>
      <p>Edith Hamilton, although not a philosopher like her other peers, is recognized as a Greek translator. She succeeded in compiling the dialogues accepted as Platonic along with his letters and three other dialogues in her edition. Notably, a significant portion of the translations present in her Collected Dialogues represent Benjamin Jowett’s translations. Her edition was considered the most complete reference until Cooper’s edition, but is now considered outdated and incomplete. Criticism is directed towards her introductions and commentaries that are considered simplistic, with her commentaries not standing out in her edition.</p>
      <p>As for John Cooper, he is the most modern among all the complete editions, and his edition includes all the accepted, spurious, letters, and inscriptions dialogues. Nearly everything attributable to Plato is available in his edition. It is currently recommended by most colleges to their students, and is praised for its completeness, and for being the best in commentary, introductions, notes, and translation compared to the other two editions. Therefore, my brothers, this version is the best way to read Plato’s works in full. And it is also worth mentioning that Plato’s works are essentially an excellent introduction to philosophy in general.</p>
