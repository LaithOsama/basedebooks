      <p>Julius Evola was born on May 19, 1898, in Rome, Italy, and passed away on June 11, 1974, in the same city. He was an Italian philosopher, esotericist, and political thinker who played a significant role in the development of traditionalist thought in the 20th century. Evola’s life and work were deeply influenced by his experiences during World War I and the political and social turmoil of his time, he came from an aristocratic background and developed a deep interest in philosophy, spirituality, and the occult from an early age.</p>
      <p>Evola came from a middle-class family and showed an early interest in art and literature. He studied engineering at the University of Rome but abandoned his studies to volunteer for the Italian army during World War I. The war had a profound impact on Evola, as he was seriously wounded and spent a long period in hospitals, which gave him ample time for introspection and intellectual development.</p>
      <p>After the war, Evola delved into various intellectual pursuits, including art, literature, and Eastern philosophy. He traveled extensively, seeking spiritual and philosophical knowledge from different cultures and traditions. These experiences formed the basis for his later writings and philosophical system.</p>
      <p>Evola’s philosophy can be best understood from the perspective of traditional philosophy, which emphasizes the importance of transcendent truths, spiritual principles, and hierarchical order in human society. He rejected the modern world and its materialistic values, considering it to be in a state of decline and decadence. Evola believed that traditional values, rooted in metaphysical and spiritual truths, were the key to restoring order and meaning in contemporary society.</p>
      <p>Central to Evola’s philosophy was the concept of “Tradition”, which he defined as the timeless and perennial wisdom that underlies all genuine spiritual and philosophical systems. He argued that Tradition provided a transcendent framework for understanding the world and offered a path to transcendence and self-realization.</p>
      <p>Evola’s thought encompassed various domains, including metaphysics, politics, spirituality, and esotericism. He wrote extensively on topics such as the nature of reality, the role of the individual in society, the crisis of modernity, and the possibilities for spiritual transformation.</p>
