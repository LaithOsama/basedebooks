      <h2>A Road to Nowhere</h2>
      <p>In his book A Road to Nowhere: The Idea of Progress and Its Critics, historian Matthew W. Slaboch examines the concept of “progress” - its emergence and evolution - while highlighting major critics of the idea throughout history.</p>
      <p>Slaboch traces the roots of progress in Western thought from ancient Greece, through the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution. He also sheds light on the development of skeptical and critical perspectives on the notion of indefinite linear advancement of humanity.</p>
      <p>Slaboch concludes that the idea of progress has faced increasing credibility challenges in the modern era, as its negative repercussions on the environment and society have been revealed. He calls for reimagining progress in line with real human needs.</p>
      <p>The book provides penetrating and comprehensive insight into the history and philosophy of one of the most influential and controversial concepts in modern Western civilization.</p>
